## Mode Selection Guidelines

### When to Use Each Mode

**For New Projects:**
1. Start with **Orchestrator** to plan overall approach
2. Use **Researcher** for technology selection
3. Switch to **Architect** for system design
4. Progress to **TDD** or **Coder** for implementation

**For Existing Projects:**
1. Use **Analyzer** to understand current state
2. Apply **Reviewer** for quality assessment
3. Use **Optimizer** for performance improvements
4. Apply **Debugger** for issue resolution

**For Specific Tasks:**
- Bug fixes: **Debugger** → **Tester**
- New features: **TDD** → **Coder** → **Reviewer**
- Performance: **Analyzer** → **Optimizer**
- Documentation: **Documenter**
- Research: **Researcher** → **Memory-Manager**

### Coordination Patterns

**Sequential Pattern:**
```
Researcher → Architect → TDD → Coder → Reviewer → Tester
```

**Parallel Pattern:**
```
Orchestrator spawns:
├── Researcher (gather requirements)
├── Architect (design system)
└── Documenter (prepare docs)
```

**Iterative Pattern:**
```
Coder ↔ Tester ↔ Debugger (until tests pass)
```

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. **Mode Initialization**
- Always start with clear objectives
- Use TodoWrite to track mode-specific tasks
- Store findings in Memory for cross-mode access

### 2. **Tool Usage**
- Each mode has optimized tool access
- Use batch operations when possible
- Leverage parallel execution capabilities

### 3. **Memory Integration**
- Store key decisions and findings
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Enable knowledge sharing across modes

### 4. **Progress Tracking**
- Use TodoWrite/TodoRead extensively
- Update task status in real-time
- Monitor agent performance

### 5. **Error Handling**
- Each mode should handle failures gracefully
- Use circuit breakers for repeated failures
- Log errors for debugging

## Command Usage

### Basic Mode Execution
```bash
# Run default orchestrator mode
claude-flow sparc "Build user authentication system"

# Run specific mode
claude-flow sparc run researcher "Research OAuth 2.0 best practices"
claude-flow sparc run tdd "User registration feature"

# List available modes
claude-flow sparc modes

# Get mode information
claude-flow sparc info coder
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Run with monitoring
claude-flow sparc run architect "Design microservices architecture" --monitor

# Parallel execution
claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement API endpoints" --parallel

# With memory namespace
claude-flow sparc run researcher "Security best practices" --memory-namespace security
```

## Integration with Swarm System

SPARC modes integrate seamlessly with the swarm orchestration system:

1. **Swarm Strategies** map to SPARC modes:
   - Research strategy → Researcher mode
   - Development strategy → Coder/TDD modes
   - Analysis strategy → Analyzer mode

2. **Coordination Modes** determine agent interaction:
   - Centralized: Orchestrator controls all
   - Distributed: Agents self-organize
   - Hierarchical: Team-based structure
   - Mesh: Full peer-to-peer
   - Hybrid: Mixed approach

3. **Memory Sharing** enables:
   - Cross-mode knowledge transfer
   - Persistent project state
   - Collaborative development

## Conclusion

The SPARC methodology with its 17 specialized modes provides a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted software development. By selecting the appropriate mode for each task and leveraging the coordination capabilities of claude-flow, developers can achieve efficient, high-quality software development with intelligent agent collaboration.
